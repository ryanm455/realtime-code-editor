# Realtime Code Editor

A basic realtime code editor that enables users to create temporary accounts and join collaborative "rooms." In these rooms, users can create, modify, and organize files and folders in a shared directory. Changes are synced in real-time, allowing multiple users to edit the same file simultaneously. Users can also view their profiles, manage their rooms, and delete their accounts.

## Features
- **Realtime Collaboration:** Edit files in real-time with other users in shared rooms.
- **Temporary Accounts:** Create temporary accounts for quick access.
- **Room Management:** Create, manage, and delete rooms for different projects.
- **Profile Management:** View and manage your profile and rooms.
- **File Organization:** Create and organize files and folders within rooms.
